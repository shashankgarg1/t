 *  DutyCycleAccessManager relies on simulation time to determine ON and OFF periods.
 *  There are 3 parameters to configure: OnDuration, OnStartTime and DutyCyclePeriod.
 *  Simulation time is seen as series duty cycle periods. OnDuration defines duration
 *  of ON period duration during single duty cycle period. DutyCyclePeriod is total
 *  duration of ON and OFF period. OnStartTime defines at which time of DutyCyclePeriod
 *  is starting the ON period. E.g. by using these 3 parameters it could be configured
 *  that different duty cycle channel access managers have the same duty cycle period,
 *  but that ON periods do not overlap. The precision of this duty cycle is at nano seconds
 *  level.
